## üìù Manual Testing Procedures

Since automated UI testing encountered structural issues, manual testing is the recommended approach. Follow these comprehensive test procedures:

### Phase 1: Authentication & Access Control Testing

#### 1.1 Login Functionality Test
**Manual Steps:**
1. Open browser and navigate to `localhost:8081`
2. Verify login page displays correctly
3. Test each role's credentials from the matrix above
4. Verify proper dashboard redirection occurs
5. Test invalid credentials show appropriate error messages

**Expected Results:**
- Login page loads without errors
- Valid credentials redirect to appropriate dashboard
- Invalid credentials show error messages
- Session persists across browser refresh

#### 1.2 Role-Based Access Control
**Test each role:**
```
Centre Admin: 
‚úì Access to centre@pmajay.gov.in dashboard
‚úó Blocked from other role dashboards

State Officer:
‚úì Access to state@pmajay.gov.in dashboard  
‚úó Blocked from other role dashboards

Agency User:
