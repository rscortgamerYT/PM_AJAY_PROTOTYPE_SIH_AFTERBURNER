## 6. Known Limitations & Future Work

### 6.1 Backend Integration
**Status**: Mock data currently in use  
**Next Steps**:
- Connect to Supabase for real-time data
- Implement API endpoints for Fund Flow transactions
- Add authentication flow with Supabase Auth
- Enable real-time subscriptions for alerts

### 6.2 Performance Optimizations
**Recommended**:
- Replace `withOpacity` with `.withValues()` (50+ occurrences)
- Add const constructors where possible (200+ locations)
- Implement lazy loading for large transaction lists
- Add pagination for Fund Flow Explorer table
- Optimize Sankey chart rendering for large datasets

### 6.3 Testing Coverage
**Completed**: Basic smoke test  
**Recommended**:
- Unit tests for all widgets (use unit_test_generator tool)
- Integration tests for navigation flows
- Widget tests for interactive features
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- Performance tests for large datasets
